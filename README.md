## Abstract 
The reliance of students on university staff for information proves time-consuming for both parties, and the increasing student population exacerbates the issue. This project addresses the challenges faced by university students, particularly in navigating university resources and efficiently managing course registration.
Our provided solution is a mobile application featuring a chatbot that answers frequently asked questions, providing instant support to students. Additionally, the app includes a schedule generation tool to streamline the registration process and allow students to select a suitable semester schedule.
The results included heightened student awareness of university resources and a simplified registration experience, ultimately enhancing overall satisfaction with the university journey. The project's deliverables encompass a user-friendly mobile app for both iOS and Android, equipped with a knowledgeable chatbot that achieved 89% accuracy and a conflict-free schedule generator that was tested using various real-world test cases. This project successfully achieved significant milestones in meeting the needs of university students.
